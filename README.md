# Practical Machine Learning Assignment  
###Background  
  
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement ? a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).   
  
  
  
  
###Data   
  
  
The training data for this project are available here:

The test data are available here:

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.   
  
What needs to be submitted:  
  
The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. Any of the other variables to predict with can be used. A report needs to be created describing how the model is built, how cross validation is used, what is the expected out of sample error is, and why the choices are made. Also, the prediction model needs to be used to predict 20 different test cases.   
  
1. The submission should consist of a link to a Github repo with R markdown and compiled HTML file describing analysis.   
2. Also machine learning algorithm needs to be applied to the 20 test cases available in the test data above.
